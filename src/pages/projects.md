## TaleSprout

[TaleSprout](https://www.talesprout.com/) is a web application for authors who want to generate stories using AI without losing control of the narrative. Rather than writing, the author gives directions to the AI on what to write next or how to modify an existing piece of text.

It's ideal for authors of D&D campaigns, short stories, and novels. It's also a great tool for writers who don't speak English as their first language, allowing for the AI to drive the eloquence of the story while the author focuses on the plot.

It is built using the [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) framework, [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), and [PostgresQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). It is deployed using [Render.com](https://render.com/).
