These are simple and fun (and not so simple, but still fun) side projects that I've worked on in my free time.

## TaleSprout

[TaleSprout](https://www.talesprout.com/) is a web application for authors who want to generate stories using AI without losing control of the narrative. Rather than writing, the author gives directions to the AI on what to write next or how to modify an existing piece of text.

It's ideal for authors of D&D campaigns, short stories, and novels. It's also a great tool for writers who don't speak English as their first language, allowing for the AI to drive the eloquence of the story while the author focuses on the plot.

It is built using the [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) framework, [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), and [PostgresQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). It is deployed using [Render.com](https://render.com/).

## AI World Builder

[AI World Builder](https://github.com/kvintessents/aid-world-builder) was a companion app for the [AI Dungeon](https://www.aidungeon.com/) game. It allowed the user to create and manage complex worlds and characters that could be used in the game.

At it's height it has something like 100 unique users per day, but it was eventually shut down due to lack of time for making it more robust, feature complete and monetizable.

## Mayan

[Mayan](https://github.com/amiran-gorgazjan/mayan) is a poly-repository manager and a Git wrapper that drastically improves productivity by reducing the amount of time and mental overhead required to manage multiple repositories. If you're working in a company that has a ton of Git repositories, you can use Mayan instead of Git to avoid having to manage each repository individually. It allows the user to have an experience similar to that of a monorepo.

## Chat GPT Language Teacher

[Chat GPT Language Teacher](https://github.com/amiran-gorgazjan/chatgpt-language-teacher) is a simple web application that allows you to converse with ChatGPT in any language.

## Predator-prey simulation

[Predator-prey simulation](https://github.com/kvintessents/predator-prey) is a cellular automata simulation of a predator-prey ecosystem. It uses a genetic algorithm to evolve the predators and the prey.

It showcases multiple interesting concepts found in nature, such as:
* Evolution
* Natural selection
* Oscillation of predator and prey populations
* Speciation

It uses web-workers to solve the cellular automata grid in parallel for improved performance.

## Worlde Solver

[Worlde Solver](https://github.com/amiran-gorgazjan/wordle-solver) is a simple Worlde solver. It uses a dictionary to find all possible words that can be made from the given letters.
